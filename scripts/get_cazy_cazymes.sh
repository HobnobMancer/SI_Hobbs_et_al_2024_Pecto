# get_cazy_cazymes

# Get CAZy family classifications for proteins in the proteomes that are also in the local CAZymes db
# Proteins in the proteomes not in the local CAZyme db are written to FASTA Files to be parsed by dbCAN
# Write the protein accessions, genomic accessions and CAZy families to tab delimited lists
